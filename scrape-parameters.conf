# URLs are not url-encoded.  They're as they would appear in a web browser
# address bar.  Note that generally when they contain a dash, as in "A–Z",
# the dash is a unicode en dash, and not an ascii hyphen.  However, Wikipedia
# seems to often (maybe always?) redirect if you put the "wrong" kind of dash
# into the URL.

# scrape types: table, alphabetical tables, alphabetical lists

# if <b>\d+\.)</b> appears in column 0, go to column 1. (atari 2600)

# ps2 page has "# 0-9" for the 0-9 section.

# virtualboy only has about 20 games.

# build an on-disk cache.  if the old version was up-to-date, or if maybe the
# wikipedia page had been edited too recently (possible spam/garbage), then
# skip fetching/parsing and just keep using the old one cached on disk.
